# Bryt Designs Front-end Tech Challenge
### React and Vanilla Js Multi-step Forms

### Hello fellow candidate! üëã
###### Today's challenge is to build two versions of a multi-step form, one version using Javascript/JQuery, HTML, CSS/Bootstrap and the other version using React and CSS/Tailwindcss. The styling is completely up to you, feel free to get creative üòé!

### Why a multi-step form? ü§î
###### We believe it's the best challenge to demonstrate your technical skills, problem solving and your knowledge of HTML and CSS basics.

### Why the two different tech stacks? üë®‚Äçüíª
###### The reason for the two different tech stacks has to do with the technology we use everyday. While we are moving our tech stack be more React/JS focused, some of our older projects that we maintain still use Vanilla Javascript and JQuery.

### What's the goal of this challenge? ‚öΩ
###### I'm glad you asked! We want to get an understanding of your abilities by measuring how creative you can be, how readable your code is and how you approach problems.

### What's the process like?
###### You have 4 hours from project start to complete this challenge and submit your repo via email for review.
